The ultimate goal is for the computer science curriculum to adequately prepare students for a career in software engineering in the current landscape with LLMs (Large Language Models). The paper presents three research questions (RQs), which are: RQ1: \"How often do students use the diverse features of GitHub Copilot when adding a small feature to a large codebase?\" RQ2: \"How do students typically interact with the GitHub Copilot chat?\" RQ3: \"How much do students trust the output of GitHub Copilot for code generation and code comprehension features?\" The highlighted objectives are to prepare students for the effective use of LLMs in software engineering, developing skills such as navigating and modifying large codebases, best practices in using these tools, verification and debugging of LLM-generated outputs, in addition to fundamental competencies like decomposition, testing, and debugging. The paper seeks to teach how students can utilize GitHub Copilot as a tool to assist with complex software engineering tasks, such as working with extensive codebases, emphasizing the need for critical skills in verification, debugging, and decomposition, in addition to understanding the code itself.", "aiEmployment": "Initially, the instructor introduced Copilot's features in two lectures, with live demonstrations (such as the /explain, /fix, and /tests commands, etc.). Subsequently, students completed a small in-class activity using the tool. The main practical application occurred during an assignment that required adding a feature to a large, real-world codebase, within the context of the course (Working with Large Codebases). During this task, Copilot usage was observed through process diaries and chat transcripts, with the aim of understanding its application in real-world scenarios and reinforcing skills such as decomposition, verification, and debugging of AI-generated code. The primary objective was to observe how these students utilized the tool when tackling a complex programming task in a setting closer to a professional environment. The prompts and interactions with the AI were created by the students themselves while completing a designated programming task.
